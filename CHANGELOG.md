## [0.0.4] - 2019-11-13
### Added
- Added link to GitHub repository in footer
### Changed
- Toggling "Find Resulting Words?" after performing a search and resetting it no longer shows you results from your previous search

## [0.0.3] - 2019-11-06
### Added
- Added an undo button in case the player makes a mistake
  - Undo button is disabled when Rush mode is toggled
  - Undo button only allows for one undo
- Added the option to search for the phrases that the word you selected can go into in Word Search
### Changed
- Tips formatting
- Word list is now hidden when a game is in progress to avoid tampering
  - It will be shown when the game in progress is reset.
### Fixed
- Fixed(?) a visual error with the currently selected phrase's character going out of bounds when a ん has been hit on mobile devices

## [0.0.2] - 2019-11-04
### Added
- Added a gold card highlight for Kaya's turn to indicate what she needs to pick for the user to get a new phrase
- Word Search table that allows users to reverse search a word to see which words they need to go through prior to accessing it
### Changed
- Green highlight is now a higher priority than Blue since it has a lower chance to occur
- Edited tips to match new information
- Urayomi phrases are now hidden at the start since Kaya will never select them
  - Some futsuyomi phrases are now hidden from the start since it looks like Kaya only chooses only the first futsuyomi phrase and none of the others
  - Additional futsuyomi phrases that start with ん are also now hidden from the start (choosing them causes an instant game over)
- Made it so the starting phrase list only updates when the word list is closed if a change was made
- I 100% cleared the word catalog, so I went through and edited some words to match how they're spelled in-game
  - bomb ; `みそぎのいたずらグッズ` -> `ミソギのいたずらグッズ`
  - microphone ; `アイドルのひっすあいてむ` -> `アイドルのひっすアイテム`
  - nanaka ; `さいかわ` -> `サイカワ`
  - kaori ; `はいたーい` -> `ハイタ～イ`
  - rin ; `グウタラ` -> `ぐうたら`
  - tomo ; `みくまりゆう` -> `ミクマりゅう`
  - tamaki ; `ねこむすめ` -> `ネコむすめ`
  - tsumugi ; `レイ様ファンクラブ` -> `レイさまファンクラブ`
  - kyaru ; `やばいわよ` -> `ヤバイわよ`
  - This is also probably the last time I'm messing around with the word list.
- Adjusted some button spacing to make it consistent throughout
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where the green highlight shared the same requirement as priconneyomi

  - `Red` Color: Kaya and the Player has a chance of both selecting new phrases
- Added a Tips menu to explain what the different highlights/image styling means
- Added error catching so a user's word list isn't completely screwed with every error in word_list.json
